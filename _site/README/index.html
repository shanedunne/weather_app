<h3>Index / Home</h3>
<p>Home page displaying cards for each of the cities, representing their weather summary of the day. Each card is clickable, and will bring the user to the City Focus page of the clicked city</p>
<h3>City Focus</h3>
<p>This page provides information for a specific cities weather.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, a summary card of todays weather is seen for quick information.</li>
<li>A table displaying the hourly weather breakdown for today is then seen.</li>
<li>The next section contains cards, summarising the next 6 days of weather in the specific city. These cards are clicked</li>

</ul>
<h3>Preferences</h3>

<ul>
<li>Favourite Cities</li>

<ul>
<li>Users can chose their favourite cities, which will be displayed on the favourite cities page. This information is stored in local storage</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Users can choose which data points they want to see displayed on the hourly breakdown tables. This information is stored in local storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Favourite Cities</h3>
<p>This page shows summary cards of todays weather of only the chosen cities in the preferences page. If no favourite cities have been selected, the page will display a message stating this, directing users to the preference page if they would like to avail of this feature.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>Intention</h3>
<p>The design intention was to create a well laid out and simple website to allow for easy navigation. I wanted the user to be able to easily find the information they require, especially when it came to the hourly weather table, as there is a lot of data points in the one space.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A user can navigate to the site and view all available cities. If they are from Cork and are only interested in Cork weather, they can go to 'Preferences' and select Cork as a favourite city. Now, they can navigate to the Favourite City page and only see a summary card for Cork. This card is clickable and leads to the Cork city focus page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user may be travelling between Berlin and Amsterdam over the course of a few days and may want to track both cities. The user can select both as favourite cities and will only see them specifically in the Favourite Cities page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a user only cares about rain and temperature, they may want to go to the Preferences page and deselect all data points except 'temperature, rain, chance of rain'. This will minimise the data displayed when viewing the hourly breakdowns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
